💥Blang.js🔥 is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyfill">pollyfill</a> for the `<BLINK>` tag.

Actually, it's more than that.  It's a movement.  A movement to make the web great again (#MWGA)!!

In 2013 elitist designers, [accessibility "experts"](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/text.html#lining-striking-props), and 
epilepsy-nazis removed the `<BLINK>` tag. 🔫Blang.js🎉 restores the web to its former glory.

How To Use
==========
Just drop 🤑Blang.js💆 into your sourcecode!


Why use Blang.js over some other Polyfill?
==========================================

Technical Superiority
---------------------
🍬Blang.js🍹 uses an advanced loop optimization technique known as a reverse while loop for [ultimate speed](https://jsperf.com/while-reverse-vs-for-cached-length).

🏦Blang.js🌋 is perfectly conformant with the original `<BLINK>` tag, the blink rate is derived from the original Mozilla
 sourcecode and does not support any extraneous features.

🔨Blang.min.js🗜 is only 181 BYTES!  It's so small, zip "compression" only increases the size of the file!

License Superiority
-------------------
📀Blang.js🍭 is available under the Microsoft Public License.  While we would prefer to use the Microsoft Limited 
Reciprocal License (Ms-LRL), the Open Source mob has forced us to adopt an Open Source certified license.

Divine Authority
----------------
The sourcecode was channeled by our leader **directly** from on-high during a 3-day bender. It wasn't just cloned from 
some other blink polyfill nor kludged together by copying and pasting examples from Wikipedia and StackOverflow.  Thus, 
it is prefect, akin to [TempleOS](http://www.templeos.org/).
