Background
----------

In 2013, Mozilla removed support for the `<BLINK>` tag. But on a cold winter evening in 2016, [the great Noodly one](FSM) took pity on all of humanity and touched its prophet with its noodly appendage.
During the following 3-day ~~bender~~ spiritual quest, FSM revealed that the removal of `<BLINK>` was actually a collusion between The Cult of Minimalism and the Epilepsy Buzzkill Foundation to corrupt web design.

Following this revelation, FSM took control of the keyboard and channeled through its prophet <blink>Blink.js</blink>, the immaculate `<BLINK>` polyfill.
<blink>Blink.js</blink> isn't just some code that was kluged together from StackOverflow answers, it is a programming **miracle** on par with TempleOS!

<blink>Blink.js</blink>:

* Matches the EXACT <blink>blink</blink> rate of the original Gecko source code. 
* Extends the `String` prototype to include the native [`blink` utility function](blink()) (`$('#blang').blink()`).
* Achieves [ultimate speed](loop) via a **highly** advanced loop optimization technique known as a *reverse while loop*.
* Compressed to less than 50 BYTES in size!  <blink>Blink.js</blink> is so minified and compressed it downloads [instantaneously](http://www.download-time.com/)!!!!

But however **incredible** <blink>Blink.js</blink> is, the polyfill was only FSM's way of proving the divine nature of its *ultimate* revelation: the  `<BLANG>` tag; an Ark of Blanging Web Design!

You see, the problem with `<BLINK>` is that it wasn't *semantic* HTML.  HTML is structural, it is supposed to convey the meaning of the information, not how it is presented.
Tags such as `<i>`, `<b>`, and `<u>` force structural elements to be styled a certain way.  That's why they were replaced with `<em>`, `<strong>`, and `<span style="text-decoration: underline">`.
The `<BLANG>` tag is a semantic `<BLINK>` HTML replacement capable of encompassing every blanging web design pattern: `<BLINK>`, `<MARQUEE>`, and animated cursors.  

But #`<BLANG>` isn't just about emulating old tags.  FSM waited until 2016 because the Ark needed Web Components to be the keeper of Web Design `<BLANG>` will empower developers to summon every great web design innovation using attributes:

  * `RFC-IFY` Transform any publishing workflow into static documents formatted for a typewriter!
  * `AOL-1000000-FREE-MINUTES` `<center><font face="comic sans" color="purple">Under Construction!</font> <img src="construction.gif"></center>`
  * `IE6-WONT-DIE` Break all styling on a webpage before crashing the browser!
  * `LISTACLE-SLIDESHOW` Get more ad impressions by turning that 8 line clickbait piece into a slideshow!
  * `OMG-SOCIAL-NETWORKING` Jack up your social engagement metrics by making it easy for your readers to vote on Digg and Reddit with vote buttons or share it with everyone you've ever met on Friendster, MySpace, Facebook, Twitter, G+, Instagram, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Snapchat, Tumblr, and Ashley Madison!
  * `FACEBOOK-WONT-DIE` Load 10 megabytes of crap before freezing the browser! 
  * `INSTALL-OUR-APP` Who wouldn't want some rando forum to track your GPS location, scour your contact list, and run native code locally?!
  * `HACKER-NEWS` Turn **any** website into a one-off design that some Millennial hasn't bothered to update in a decade!
  * `FLASH-WONT-DIE` Break all continuity with the webpage and randomly freeze the browser! 
  * `OMG-STATISTICS` AI powered chatbots spit out FAQ to visitors on your website!
  
The possibilities are *endless*!
