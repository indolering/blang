Background
----------

In 2013, Mozilla removed support for the `<BLINK>` tag. But on a cold winter evening in 2016, [the great Noodly one](FSM) took pity on all of humanity and touched its prophet with its noodly appendage.
During the following 3-day ~~bender~~ spiritual quest, FSM revealed that the removal of `<BLINK>` was actually a collusion between The Cult of Minimalism and the Epilepsy Buzzkill Foundation to corrupt web design.

Following this revelation, FSM took control of the keyboard and channeled through its prophet <blink>Blink.js</blink>, the immaculate `<BLINK>` polyfill.
<blink>Blink.js</blink> isn't just some code that was kluged together from StackOverflow answers, it is a programming **miracle** on par with TempleOS!  <blink>Blink.js</blink>:

* Matches the EXACT <blink>blink</blink> rate of the original Gecko source code. 
* Extends the `String` prototype to include the native [`blink` utility function](blink()).
* Achieves [ultimate speed](loop) via a **highly** advanced loop optimization technique known as a *reverse while loop*.
* Compressed to less than 50 BYTES!  <blink>Blink.js</blink> is so minified and compressed it downloads in [0 seconds](http://www.download-time.com/)!!!!

But however **incredible** <blink>Blink.js</blink> is, the polyfill was only FSM's way of proving the divine nature of its *ultimate* revelation: the  `<BLANG>` tag; an Ark of #Blanging Web Design!

You see, the problem with `<BLINK>` is that it wasn't *semantic* HTML.  HTML is structural, it is supposed to convey the meaning of the information, not how it is presented.
Tags such as `<i>`, `<b>`, and `<u>` force structural elements to be styled a certain way.  That's why they were replaced with `<em>`, `<strong>`, and `<span style="text-decoration: underline">`.
The `<BLANG>` tag is a semantic `<BLINK>` HTML replacement capable of encompassing `<BLINK>` and `<MARQUEE>`!
 
But `<BLANG>` isn't just about emulating tags.  FSM waited until 2016 because the Ark of Web Design needed Web Components to contain every great phase of web design:

  * `<BLANG RFC-IFY>`   Transform any specification into a random pile of static documents formatted for a typewriter!
  * `<BLANG AOL-1000000-FREE-MINUTES>` Animated cursors and `<center><font face="comic sans" color="purple">Under Construction!</font> <img src="construction.gif"></center>` footers.
  * `<BLANG LISTACLE-SLIDESHOW>`    Get more ad impressions by turning that 8 line clickbait piece into a slideshow!
  * `<BLANG OMG-SOCIAL-NETWORKING>` Jack up your social engagement metrics by making it easy for your readers to share links on Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Snapchat, and Ashley Madison!
  * `<BLANG INSTALL-OUR-APP>`   Who wouldn't want some rando forum to track your GPS location, scour your contact list, and run native code locally?!
  * `<BLANG HACKER-NEWS>`   Turn **any** website into a one-off design that some Millennial hasn't bothered to update in a decade!
  * `<BLANG AI>`    Replace your FAQ section with an artificially intelligent paperclip!
