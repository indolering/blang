<blink>Blang.js</blink> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyfill">pollyfill</a> for the `<BLINK>` tag. 

But <blink>Blang.js</blink> is more than just a pollyfill: it's a movement. In 2013 elitist designers, self-appointed
 [accessibility "experts"](css2), and epilepsy-nazis killed the `<BLINK>` tag.  <blink>Blang.js</blink> will make the
 web great again (#MWGA)!
 
To use, import either `blang.js` or `blang.css`.  Either file will #blang anything wrapped in a `<blink>` tag or using a 
 `.blang` class.

Blang is available on NPM, Bower, and the jsDelivr CDN:
    

Why is <blink>Blang.js</blink> teh blangingest `<BLINK>` Polyfill Ever</blink>
=========================================================================
<blink>Blang.js</blink> was not forked from an inferior project nor kludged together by copying and pasting examples
 from Wikipedia and StackOverflow. 
 
Technical Superiority
---------------------
<blink>Blang.js</blink> is perfectly conformant with the original `<BLINK>` implementation: the blink rate is derived 
 from the Gecko sourcecode and adds the [`blink` utility function](blink()) to the `String` prototype.
 
<blink>Blang.js</blink> uses an advanced loop optimization technique known as a "reverse while loop" for [ultimate 
speed](loop).

<blink>Blang.js</blink> is less than 50 BYTES in size!  It's incredible!

License Superiority
-------------------
<blink>Blang.js</blink> is available under the Microsoft Public License.  While we would prefer to use the Microsoft
 Limited Reciprocal License (Ms-LRL), the Open Source mob has forced us to adopt an Open Source certified license.

Spiritual Superiority
----------------
<blink>Blang.js</blink> was coded during a 3-day ~~bender~~ spiritual quest during which the almighty GOD himself
 took control of the keyboard. Thus, it is prefect, akin to [TempleOS](temple).
