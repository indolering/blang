💥Blang.js🔥 is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyfill">pollyfill</a> for the `<BLINK></BLINK>`.  Actually, it's more than that.  It's a movement.  A movement to make the web great again (#MWGA).

In 2013 elitist designers, [accessibility "experts"](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/text.html#lining-striking-props), and epilepsy-nazis removed the `<BLINK></BLINK>` tag. 🔫Blang.js🎉
restores the web to its former glory.

How To Use
==========
Just drop 🤑Blang.js💆 into your sourcecode!


Why use Blang.js over some other Polyfill?
==========================================

Technical Superiority
---------------------
🍬Blang.js🍹 uses advanced loop optimization technique known as a reverse while loop, which [beats out even cached for loops!](https://jsperf.com/while-reverse-vs-for-cached-length)

🏦Blang.js🌋 is also striclty standards based, the blink rate is derived from the original Mozilla sourcecode and does not
support any extraneous features.

🔨Blang.min.js🗜 is only 181 BYTES!  It's so small, zip "compression" only increases the size of the file!

License Superiority
-------------------
📀Blang.js🍭 is available under the Microsoft Public License.  While we would prefer to use the Microsoft Limited Reciprocal License (Ms-LRL),
the open source mob has forced us to adopt an Open Source certified license, the best of which is the MS-PL.

Divine Authority
----------------
The sourcecode was channeled by our leader **directly** from on-high during a 3-day bender. It wasn't just cloned from some other blink polyfill or kludged together
  by copying and pasting examples from Wikipedia and StackOverflow.  Thus, it is perfect, ranking alongisde [TempleOS](http://www.templeos.org/).
