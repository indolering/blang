In 2013, Mozilla removed support for the `<BLINK>` tag. During a 3-day ~~bender~~ spiritual quest, God revealed that the Cult of Minimalism had colluded with epliletic buzzkills to corrupt web design. Then his Noodly appendeges took control of the keyboard and produced <blink>Blink.js</blink>, a `<BLINK>` <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyfill">pollyfill</a>.  But <blink>Blink.js</blink> isn't just some code that was kluged together from StackOverflow answers, it is a programming **miracle**:

* Matches the EXACT blink rate of the Gecko source code. 
* Extends the `String` prototype to include the [`blink` utility function](blink()).
* [Ultimate speed](loop) achieved via an advanced loop optimization technique known as a *reverse while loop*.
* Less than 50 BYTES in size!  It downloads in [zero seconds](http://www.download-time.com/).

However incredible <blink>Blink.js</blink> is, it was only FSM's way of proving the divine nature of its *ultimate* revalation: an Ark of the web's Blangingest design patterns!

#`<BLANG>`

* Semantic HTML replacement for `<BLINK>`, `<MARQUEE>`, animated cursors, social links, and 🛅🛅🛅🛅🛅🛅🛅Emojis🛅🛅🛅🛅🛅🛅🛅 all IN ONE ELEMENT!
* WebComponents + flexible configuation using properties + data-binding = MBBC!
* `<BLANG X-SKIN="NAME">` provides presets for every web design epoch!
 * `RFC-IFY` Transform any publishing workflow into static documents formatted for a typewriter!
 * `AOL-1000-FREE-MINUTES` Softcore porn at a blazing 15Kb/s!
 * `IE6-WONT-DIE` Breaks all styling before freezing the browser with an infinite `for` loop! 
 * `LISTACLE-SLIDESHOW` Get MOAR impressions by turning that 8 line clickbait piece into a slideshow!
 * `OMG-SOCIAL-NETWORKING` Jack up your social engagment metrics by making it easy for your readers to vote on Digg and Reddit vote buttons or share it everyone you've ever met on Friendster, MySpace, Facebook, Twitter, or Ashley Madison!
 * `HACKER-NEWS` Turn **any** website into a one-off design that some Millenial hasn't bothered to update in a decade.

The Blang.js polyfill is on NPM, Bower, and the jsDelivr CDN:
